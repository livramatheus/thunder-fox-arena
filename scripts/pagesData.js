            <b>Thunder Fox Arena</b> is a 1 vs 1 reimagination made in JavaScript of the original 1991 game released 
            for Sega Mega Drive.
        </p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            As a developer, I constantly build stuff in my free time in order to improve my skills, but, even after 
            more than five years of experience with programming, I never took the time to build a game as I always stuck with "traditional" softwares.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a big time gamer, starting my career on my early ages, so, the process to decide which game I was 
            going to build was rather simple: recreate a 1 vs 1 version of the first game that I played, when I was 
            4 or 5 years old. Thunder Fox really has its own place in my heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another factor that inspired me to make this game, was a <a target="_blank" 
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ">YouTube video</a> that was suggested to me about 
            JavaScript game development. Even though I'm an experienced developer, I was jumping into <em>unknown 
            territory</em>, since this is my first game ever developed, so, this video tutorial taught me some solutions
            that I probably wouldn't be able to come up with on my own.
